				Hi. This is Nabil. I&lsquo;m a full-stack developer. My
				enthusiasm for programming revolved around my interest in
				computers and the feeling of satisfaction and contentment
				overcoming a big obstacle. Programming allows me to do that!
				Both the brief mental strain of challenges faced in programming
				and the feeling of joy gives me the adrenaline rush.
